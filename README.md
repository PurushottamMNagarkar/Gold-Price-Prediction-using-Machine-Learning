# Gold-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Project #2

A project from scratch about Gold price prediction. To build any data science project We have to follow certain steps that need not be in the same order. In our project, We will go through these steps sequentially.

Problem Formulation 
Data preprocessing 
Data wrangling
Model Development
Model Explainability
Model Deployment
Problem Formulation
Problem Formulation is one of the most important steps We do before starting any project. there has to be a clear idea about the goal of our data science project. In our case, the goal of this project is to analyze the price of gold. The price of gold is volatile, they change rapidly with time. Our main Aim of this project will be to predict the price of gold per unit. 

Importing Libraries 
We will import all the libraries that we will be using throughout this article in one place so that do not have to import every time we use it this will save both our time and effort.

Pandas – A Python library built on top of NumPy for effective matrix multiplication and dataframe manipulation, it is also used for data cleaning, data merging, data reshaping, and data aggregation 
Numpy – A Python library that is used for numerical mathematical computation and handling multidimensional ndarray, it also has a very large collection of mathematical functions to operate on this array 
Matplotlib – It is used for plotting 2D and 3D visualization plots, it also supports a variety of output formats including graphs 
Seaborn – seaborn library is made on top of Matplotlib it
